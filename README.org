Org-hide-drawers "hides" org-mode drawers. "Hiding," in this case, means using overlays with the display property set to visually shorten them. This includes both property drawers and drawers in general (which are different org elements). The goal of this project is to reduce the visual clutter of org-mode buffers with many drawers.

You can see in the screenshot below that several drawers are displayed as a hash sign (“#”) at the end of the line above where you’d normally see it:

* Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: usage
:END:

1. Open an org buffer.
2. Enable ~org-hide-drawers-mode~. Drawers become "hidden": their displayed text is changed to ~org-hide-drawers-display-string~.
3. Un-hide drawers by calling ~org-hide-drawers-toggle~ or ~org-hide-drawers-make-overlays~.
4. Hide drawers by calling ~org-hide-drawers-toggle~ again, or ~org-hide-drawers-delete-overlays~.

+ [[https://github.com/jxq0/org-tidy][jxq0/org-tidy]]
  Org-tidy aims to fulfill the same purpose as this project: hiding org-mode drawers with overlays. However, our implementations differ. This project's implementation fixes many of [[https://github.com/jxq0/org-tidy/issues][the existing bugs]] in that package. Org-tidy’s bugs are closely tied to its implementation, so org-hide-drawers resolves them by implementing similar functionality differently.

  Additionally, this project's code base has fewer lines of code and its logic is much easier to extend, thus affording more flexibility with potential future features.
