Org-hide-drawers "hides" org-mode drawers. "Hiding," in this case, means using overlays with the display property set to visually shorten them. This includes both property drawers and drawers in general (which are different org elements). The goal of this project is to reduce the visual clutter of org-mode buffers with many drawers.

* Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: usage
:END:

1. Open an org buffer.
2. Enable ~org-hide-drawers-mode~. Drawers become "hidden": their displayed text is changed to ~org-hide-drawers-display-string~.
3. Un-hide drawers by calling ~org-hide-drawers-toggle~.
4. Hide drawers by calling ~org-hide-drawers-toggle~ again, or ~org-hide-drawers-delete-overlays~.

+ [[https://github.com/jxq0/org-tidy][jxq0/org-tidy]]
  Org-tidy aims to fulfill the same purpose as this project: hiding overlays in org-mode. However, the implementation is very different. This project's implementation fixes many of [[https://github.com/jxq0/org-tidy/issues][the bugs]] in that package. Importantly, that package's bugs, as far as I can tell, are closely tied to the implementation of org-tidy. To resolve those bugs, in my opinion, would be to rewrite the package to a state very similar to mine.

  Additionally, this project's code base has much fewer lines of code and has logic much easier to extend, thus affording more flexibility with potential future features.
